# Project-Squared
Simple and easy Real Time Strategy game engine that focuses on gameplay and not on graphics.

### Project Description
Simple and easy Real Time Strategy game engine that features vector graphics. Engine's written in C#, with help of XNA Game Framework (4.0), giving us ability to deploy to a wider range of platforms. Interesting fact: 2D shapes are rendered using vector graphics, in that way we get this very simple and cartoonish look.
